# AMA - FE Assessment

Welcome to the AMA FE Engineer coding challenge.

In this challenge, you will be asked to update, refactor, or extend functionality in this application. This application manages a list of hospitals, their addresses, and their rating. There are 3 pages, a dashboard, a list/form (Hospitals), and a details view.

Instructions for each task can be found in this readme. Please use best practices when solving these tasks.

This challenge shouldn't take more than an hour or so to complete, so please timebox your efforts. There are a couple bonus/extra tasks that you can complete if you have time.

# Startup
Install the dependencies using `npm i`
If needed, install the Angular CLI `npm i -g @angular/cli`


# Task 1

In the Dashboard component, update the "Top Hospitals" list to sort the displayed hospitals in order of their rating (5 is high, 1 is low).


# Task 2

In the hospital-detail component, repair the "Address" display to show a correctly formatted address. Ex) 123 Main St, Chicago, IL 60606


# Task 3

In the hospital component, update the page to include address and rating input fields. When you click "Add hospital", all of this data should be propogated to the BE and stored.


# Task 4
In the Dashboard component, update the "Top Hospitals" list to display the icon, name, address, and rating for each of the top hospitals.


# Bonus
Update the rating system to display stars instead of numbers.
